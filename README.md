# Strong enough to be gentle ðŸ’ªðŸ’–

What does it mean to be strong? Does it mean to be tough, uncompromizing, always in control?

It does not.


I believe that true strength is achieved only when one has the capability to be gentle to themselves **and** others.

Can I be strong enough to understand myself, be calm, warm, and yet have clear boundaries, self-respect, self-love, self-acceptance and extend all of these to others?

How do I navigate life, relationships, and most importantly - the relationship with myself?

I love this video by Peter Cullen, the late voice actor of Optimus Prime in the Transformers movie. In this video he talks about what strength is and the inspiration from his brother:

# The toolkit (a book of tools)
With the help of others, through books, experience, research, workshops, presentations, talks, and thousands of hours of discussion, I assembled a toolkit. 

Everything in this toolkit has helped me achieve peace of mind, have better relationships, understand my subconscious, and enjoy the hurdles and joys of life.

I spent years researching, practicing, and teaching self-care and wellbeing during in-person workshops, talks, discussions with friends and strangers, both offline and online. I organized discussion groups, training and helped many people 1:1 during conversations. 

Some of these discussions changed lives.

The toolkit is free. It's information I would have liked to know decades ago.

I am confident would make the world better if it was taught in schools.
