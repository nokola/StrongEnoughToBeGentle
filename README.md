# Strong enough to be gentle

What does it mean to be mentally strong?

"If you're going to be a hero Peter, be a real hero. ... There was a seriousness in him. The way he talked...there was a smoothness in it."

"Be strong enough to be gentle. Be compassionate."

Are you strong enough to be gentle to yourself? To others? Do you enjoy what life has to offer?
