# Strong enough to be gentle ðŸ’ªðŸ’–

What does it mean to be strong? Does it mean to be tough, uncompromizing, always in control?

It does not.


I believe that true strength is achieved only when one has the capability to be gentle to themselves **and** others.

Can I be strong enough to understand myself, be calm, warm, and yet have clear boundaries, self-respect, self-love, self-acceptance and extend all of these to others?

How do I navigate life, relationships, and most importantly - the relationship with myself?

I love this video by Peter Cullen, the late voice actor of Optimus Prime in the Transformers movie. In this video he talks about what strength is and the inspiration from his brother:

# The self-care toolkit
I assembled a toolkit. 


Everything in this toolkit has helped me achieve peace of mind, improve my relationships, understand my subconscious, and enjoy the hurdles and joys of life.

I spent years researching, practicing, and teaching self-care and wellbeing during in-person workshops, talks, discussions with friends and strangers, both offline and online. I organized discussion groups and. training.

I conversed with people one-on-one or to audiences for 200.


Some of these discussions changed lives.

Some of them did not.

Some of them might have been harmful.

This information came to life through my experience and research in what works. I would have liked to know it decades ago.

The toolkit is free. 

I am confident would make the world better if it was taught in schools.
